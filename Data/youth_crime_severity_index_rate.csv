Footnotes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"The crime severity index is calculated using Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data. Incident-based UCR2 data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"The methodology for calculating census metropolitan area (CMA) populations was modified in 2003. Starting in 1996, the populations for CMAs have been adjusted to reflect the actual policing boundaries within the CMA and do not reflect the official Statistics Canada population for these CMAs. CMA data are included within province-level data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Police reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with minor offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might chose to deal with some minor offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Counts are based on the most serious violation in the incident.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"In January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes that consider the complexities of certain offences such as sexual assault, family violence and intimate partner violence. Under the new reporting standards, specific offences may be more likely reported by police as founded rather than unfounded (or unsubstantiated), which would exclude them from police-reported crime rates and crime severity indices. Data for 2019 represent the first complete year of UCR data collected under the new reporting standards.  As a result, for selected violations and police services, the actual proportion of incidents in 2019 that were classified as “not cleared” has increased. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"A high crime rate or Crime Severity Index (CSI) may indicate that a municipality is a geographical area that provides commercial business, human or public services, or entertainment for many people who reside outside, as well as inside, the municipality. As a result, these municipalities may have large part-time or temporary populations which are excluded from both their population bases and their crime rate and CSI calculations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"It is important to note that while official police-reported data on crime from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey use Statistics Canada's standard Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) names, the boundaries for the policing-based CMAs do not always fully align with the standard CMA geographic units used for disseminating information about the Census of Population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The 2021 Census of Population boundary changes have not yet been incorporated in police-reported crime statistics. The geographic boundaries from the 2016 Census are still being used as the base geography and changes for the 2021 Census, including new census metropolitan areas, are expected to be available in 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"With the release of 2012 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2004. This resulted in boundary changes for the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Saint John for 2005 to 2011 and for Winnipeg for 2011. Crime data for these years for these respondents have therefore been revised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"The youth violent crime severity index includes all Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) violent violations, some of which were not previously included in the aggregate violent crime category, including uttering threats, criminal harassment and forcible confinement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Population figures reflect only the permanent or resident population of a jurisdiction. Where a jurisdiction serves as the centre for commercial businesses, human or public services, or entertainment, it may have substantial “part-time” populations, e.g., tourists, cabin owners, commuters, students, and seasonal staff. These temporary populations, whose permanent residence is within another jurisdiction, are excluded from a jurisdiction’s population figures. This may be a factor to consider when examining the crime rate and Crime Severity Index for some municipalities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"In 2012, it was discovered that the Montreal Police Service had been incorrectly applying the agreed upon definition for reporting child pornography incidents to the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2). As such, the number of violations has been revised for the years 2008 to 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"In 2016, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment in Montréal underwent an exercise in making corrective measures to address under-counting of incidents importation/exportation and trafficking of drug offences. In response, Statistics Canada applied estimates to the 2015 revised data. As a result, numbers and rates from 2015 onwards should not be compared to data prior to 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"During the revision of 2001 data for the province of Ontario, a discrepancy in methodology applied by the forces in the province using the Ontario Municipal and Provincial Police Automated Co-operative (OMPPAC) system was detected. These forces report approximately one-third of the total criminal incidents for the province and include the Ontario Provincial Police and about 60 small and mid-sized municipal forces. This discrepancy resulted in an over-count of less serious criminal incidents. During 2003 and 2004, the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (CCJS) consulted with affected police services and analyzed both historical Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) data and more recent Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) microdata to determine the impact of this over-reporting. The effect at the Canada level was, on average, 1% per year from 1977 to 2000. This over-counting peaked in 1991, where it was estimated that the total crime rate for the country was over-estimated by approximately 1.8%. However, the overall historical trend changed very little. The impact in Ontario is more noticeable, but the overall trend is still very similar. On average, the effect was 2% to 3% per year, with the biggest change occurring in 1991, where the Ontario crime rate is 5% lower as a result of the adjustment. For further information, refer to the report: <a href=http://www.statcan.gc.ca.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/imdb-bmdi/document/3302_D13_T9_V1-eng.pdf"">Summary of Historical Adjustments to Crime Data for Ontario 1977-2000</a>.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Prior to 1999, a number of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachments in Saskatchewan were double counting the number of actual offences of impaired driving. This over-counting was corrected in 1999, therefore, comparisons with previous years should be made with caution. It is recommended that the analysis of impaired driving be based on persons charged data rather than actual offences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"The decrease in the Crime Severity Index (CSI) in Saskatchewan is partly attributable to a change in the classification of some incidents involving alcohol consumption on a dry reserve. These incidents were previously reported by some police services as violations under the Indian Act and included in “other federal statues” (6900). In 2017, due to information from the Federal Prosecutors Indigenous community by-law infractions will no longer be prosecuted under the Indian Act, these detachments began reporting these types of offences as mischief (2170) or disturbing the peace (3430) under the Criminal Code, which have a lower weight in the CSI than federal statute offences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Youth crime in British Columbia may be somewhat undercounted due to the Crown charge-approval system in place whereby, even for minor offences, there must be approval by the Crown before charges are laid after police have made an arrest. This approval is based on the substantial likelihood of conviction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"Part of the overall increase in police-reported crime in British Columbia and some of its census metropolitan areas in 2019 may be attributed to the implementation of new reporting standards for classifying incidents. More specifically, in January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes. While the effective date for the change was January 2018 and many police services adopted the new standards that year, some police services, including all of the RCMP detachments across Canada and the municipal police services in British Columbia, transitioned to the new standards on January 1, 2019. Additionally, police services in British Columbia undertook a uniform training strategy to further standardize reporting throughout the province. The new reporting standards were expected to result in an increase in crime rates over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"1998 data in this table for Northwest Territories also includes Nunavut. In 1999, Nunavut, which comprises the eastern part of the old Northwest Territories, officially became a Canadian territory. Starting in 1999, data are displayed separately for the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
